            <p>
              I am a Software Engineer who has about 4 years of working
              experience, specializing in Frontend. I have experience working at
              platform and product teams
            </p>
            <p>
              One key achievement in the platform side was increasing build
              performance of 2 webapps by 43%. Another one was optimizing API
              latency by 42%.
            </p>
            <p>
              One key achievement in the product side was working on CPO
              (cost-per-order) that drove $1.27M of revenue in only 2 months
              after launch
            </p>
            <p>
              On the product side: I've worked on E-learning platorms, Education
              Information System, CMS, Desktop Apps, Marketing sites, apps that
              uses Geo Coordinates, and more
            </p>
            <p>
              On the platform side: I've work on optimizing performance,
              building design systems, creating best practices web app
              boilerplate, define development workflows, upgrading old
              dependencies, enforcing web securities, setup/maintain CI/CD
              pipelines, and more
            </p>
            <p>
              I also am proud to have the soft skills to pay the bills :D. At
              Grab, as a new joiner, I influenced the team about best practices
              in web development and conducted team events for learning. Team
              got the chance to learn 155 relevant topics in only 1 year. There
              I was selected as a speaker of 10 out of 48 (about 20,8%) team
              sharing sessions during the yeaream sharing sessions during the
              year
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides work, I like to give back to the community and help people
              in software engineering:

                        <p>
                          As a fullstack developer, he demonstrates high-quality
                          coding and possesses solid technical skills. He is
                          keen on learning new things and can master them
                          quickly. I also notice that he is a very
                          detail-oriented person. He has made a lot of useful
                          documentation that is extremely valuable for the team.
