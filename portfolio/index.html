          <div class="background__content">
            <p>
              I am a Software Engineer who has about 4 years of working
              experience, specializing in Frontend. I have experience working at
              platform and product teams
            </p>
            <p>
              One key achievement in the platform side was increasing build
              performance of 2 webapps by 43%. Another one was optimizing API
              latency by 42%.
            </p>
            <p>
              One key achievement in the product side was working on CPO
              (cost-per-order) that drove $1.27M of revenue in only 2 months
              after launch
            </p>
            <p>
              On the product side: I've worked on E-learning platorms, Education
              Information System, CMS, Desktop Apps, Marketing sites, apps that
              uses Geo Coordinates, and more
            </p>
            <p>
              On the platform side: I've work on optimizing performance,
              building design systems, creating best practices web app
              boilerplate, define development workflows, upgrading old
              dependencies, enforcing web securities, setup/maintain CI/CD
              pipelines, and more
            </p>
            <p>
              I also am proud to have the soft skills to pay the bills :D. At
              Grab, as a new joiner, I influenced the team about best practices
              in web development and conducted team events for learning. Team
              got the chance to learn 155 relevant topics in only 1 year. There
              I was selected as a speaker of 10 out of 48 (about 20,8%) team
              sharing sessions during the yeaream sharing sessions during the
              year
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides work, I like to give back to the community and help people
              in software engineering:

                          and I can confidently say that he is an exceptional
                          colleague. He possesses exceptional technical skills,
                          consistently tackling difficult projects with great
                          success and excellent implementation. His code is
                          reliable and well-structured, which greatly
                          contributes to the overall success of our projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In addition to his technical skills, Adnan excels as
                          an excellent communicator. He has the ability to
                          explain complex concepts in a clear and concise
                          manner, ensuring that everyone on the team is on the
                          same page. His effective communication and strong
                          interpersonal skills contribute to a positive team
                          dynamic and foster a productive work environment. Many
                          of his excellent ideas and improvements have greatly
                          contributed to the success and continuous improvement
                          of our team. Adnan's willingness to share his
                          knowledge and expertise has made him a trusted
                          teammate to other team members, elevating the skills
                          of the entire team.

                          I highly endorse Adnan and have no doubt that he will
                          succeed in any future projects/works he undertakes."
