"Adnan has done a lot during his 1 year working at Grab. And I, as a co-worker, feel that I got a lot of new knowledge and experience while working with him

He initiated a storybook for UI documentation on a Grab platform. This storybook is used not only by engineers but also by product managers, UI/UX designers, and end users. In this storybook project, Adnan attended several project meetings to educate engineers to implement storybooks

He initiated the upgrade of several tools on the web. These include webpack, react 18, pre-commit hooks, etc. With this upgrade, the applications we develop are better and up to date

Adnan has also helped a lot of friends in other projects in building their projects. One way is by asking for tasks that he think he can do.

Adnan has good skills in architectural. Every time we have a discussion, he is passionate about discussing the architecture in React. We discussed the latest design patterns and techniques in React that can be implemented."
