"Adnan is one of the most passionate engineers I've met
in my time at Grab. He clearly demonstrates his
willingness to be excellent, and he clearly has an
appetite for tackling difficult problems.

Ultimately, what sets him apart from his peers is his
hunger and willingness to drive improvements within his
team. He communicates with his stakeholders effectively,
and he is capable of rounding up a group of stakeholders
together to deliver his impact effectively. I'd gladly
have Adnan on my team again"
