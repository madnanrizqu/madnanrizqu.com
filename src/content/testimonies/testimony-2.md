"It's really good working with Adnan, for more than 1
year he bring positive impact for the team and for me.

He has really good technical skills and always have will
to improve himself by taking challenging projects, or
plan what is the next improvement for our service code
base

He is rare kind of engineer, always initiate to arrange
discussion and team engagement. One of his idea is

members learn this week and share."
