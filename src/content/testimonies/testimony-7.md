"Adnan is an engineer with passion and brings energy to the team. His eagerness to perform and active participation, infects the team to want to do the same.

Though my time with Adnan is short, his characteristics make leaders want to invest in him, to see him grow successfully.

I'm sure he will continue to be excellent and grow even bigger than we can imagine.

Hope that we'll get the pleasure to work with him again"
