# Welcome to My Blog!

This is the content of my first blog post. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here.

## Markdown Works!

You can use all the standard markdown features:

-   *Italic text*
-   [Links](https://astro.build)

<MdImageContainer>
  <Picture
    src="/images/grab_illustration.svg"
    alt="A descriptive alt text for the image"
    width="770"
    height="400"
  />
</MdImageContainer>

You can also include components, like this image container.

Stay tuned for more posts!
