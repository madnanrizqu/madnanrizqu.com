# Is a Master's Degree Worth It for a Working Software Engineer? ðŸ¤”

Last month, I had the chance to talk with Fahru Muhamad about taking a Master's in Computer Science degree as a Software Engineer. We discussed why each of us took the leap and the pros & cons of the decision. You can see the full podcast here: [Podcast with Fahru Muhamad](https://lnkd.in/dVNNFuzb).

Today, I'll share the decision diagram!

TLDR; I don't think a Master's Degree for someone already working professionally as a Software Engineer is worth it, **except** in these cases:

1.  You can work full-time while you pursue the degree.
2.  You want to transition and work as a researcher.
3.  You want to get a Visa to live (and potentially work) in another country.

That being said, the experience of living overseas and studying at a world-class educational institution is something I think is really fulfilling.

Well, that's it. All of this is just my personal subjective take on the subject. Please do let me know your thoughts!
