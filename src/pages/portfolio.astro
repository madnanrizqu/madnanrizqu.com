          <p>
            I am a Software Engineer who has about 4 years of working
            experience, specializing in Frontend. I have experience working at
            platform and product teams
          </p>
          <p>
            One key achievement in the platform side was increasing build
            performance of 2 webapps by 43%. Another one was optimizing API
            latency by 42%.
          </p>
          <p>
            One key achievement in the product side was working on CPO
            (cost-per-order) that drove $1.27M of revenue in only 2 months after
            launch
          </p>
          <p>
            On the product side: I've worked on E-learning platorms, Education
            Information System, CMS, Desktop Apps, Marketing sites, apps that
            uses Geo Coordinates, and more
          </p>
          <p>
            On the platform side: I've work on optimizing performance, building
            design systems, creating best practices web app boilerplate, define
            development workflows, upgrading old dependencies, enforcing web
            securities, setup/maintain CI/CD pipelines, and more
          </p>
          <p>
            I also am proud to have the soft skills to pay the bills :D. At
            Grab, as a new joiner, I influenced the team about best practices in
            web development and conducted team events for learning. Team got the
            chance to learn 155 relevant topics in only 1 year. There I was
            selected as a speaker of 10 out of 48 (about 20,8%) team sharing
            sessions during the yeaream sharing sessions during the year
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides work, I like to give back to the community and help people
            in software engineering:
